# Policy Navigator Agent (AiXplain)

An Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying and extracting insights from complex government regulations, compliance policies, and public health guidelines.

---

## üß† What Does This Agent Do?

This project implements a multi-agent RAG system that:
- Answers user queries about government regulations, legal codes, and public health policies.
- Retrieves, summarizes, and analyzes information from multiple sources (datasets, APIs, uploaded documents).
- Integrates with external APIs (e.g., Federal Register, CourtListener) and custom tools for advanced search and summarization.
- Supports extensible agent and tool architecture for future enhancements.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-directory>
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys and tokens, or set them directly in your environment:
     - `SLACK_TOKEN` (optional, for Slack notifications)
     - `SLACK_CHANNEL` (optional)
     - `COURTLISTENER_API_TOKEN` (for CourtListener API)
     - Any other required keys (see `config.py`)
4. **Run the main app:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Integration Steps

- **aiXplain API:** Used for embedding and summarization. Configure your aiXplain credentials in your environment or `config.py`.
- **Custom Python Tools:**
  - Document parser and vector indexer for fast semantic search.
  - Handlers for ingesting and querying uploaded documents.
- **External APIs:**
  - Federal Register and CourtListener APIs are integrated via Adapter-pattern handlers. Set API tokens in your environment.
- **Adding New Tools/Agents:**
  - Implement a new handler class (see `handlers/`), register it in the main app or facade, and add to the CLI or UI.

## üîî Slack Integration

This agent can post every query and its response to a Slack channel for monitoring or collaboration.

### How to Enable

1. **Create a Slack App** and get a Bot Token (`SLACK_TOKEN`).
2. **Invite the bot** to your desired channel and get the channel ID (`SLACK_CHANNEL`).
3. **Set these environment variables** in your `.env` file:
   ```
   SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-...
   SLACK_CHANNEL=C12345678
   ```
4. When you run the agent, every query and its response will be posted to the specified Slack channel (if configured).

### Example Slack Message

```
Query: What are the penalties for issuing a bad check?
Response: Section 3310: ... (summary of penalties)
```
